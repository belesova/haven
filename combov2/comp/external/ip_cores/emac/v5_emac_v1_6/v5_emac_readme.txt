This file contains release notes for the Xilinx LogiCORE IP Virtex-5 Embedded
Tri-Mode Ethernet MAC Wrapper v1.6 solution. 
For the latest core updates, see the product page at:
 
   http://www.xilinx.com/products/ipcenter/V5_Embedded_TEMAC_Wrapper.htm

2. NEW FEATURES  
 
   - ISE 11.1i software support

 
3. RESOLVED ISSUES 

   - GMII Tri-Mode Operation Clock Management will not switch from
     10/100Mbps to 1 Gbps if MII_TX_CLK is stopped
   - See CR #492785
      - Clock management for GMII Tri-mode configuration has been
        modified to operate even when MII_TX_CLK stops
      - New clock management utilizes an additional BUFGMUX.  See 
        Embedded Tri-Mode Ethernet MAC User Guide (UG194) for more 
        information.

   - Removed PHYRESET and PHYPOWERDOWN MDIO default configuration 
     from GUI
   - See CR #471946
      - These configuration values are not propogated to the wrapper
        files to ensure that demo testbench simulation will simulate 
        correctly
      - To change the default values of the PHYRESET and PHYPOWERDOWN
        MDIO configurations, users need to modify the wrapper files 
        manually

   - Wrapper files generated for Tri-Mode GMII Clock Management with 
     Clock Enable are not consistent with Figure 6-10 of the Embedded
     Tri-Mode Ethernet MAC User Guide (UG194)
   - See CR #501317
      - Updated clock management generated by wrapper to be consistent 
        with Figure 6-10 of UG194

   - BUFG is not used to route REFCLKOUT signal from transciever
   - See CR #503642
      - Update clock management generated by the wrapper for SGMII and 
        1000Base-X PCS/PMA configurations to route REFCLKOUT using
        BUFG
      - This modification was made to ensure that REFCLKOUT is routed
        using dedicated routing and is consistent with the
        recommendation stated in the RocketIO GTP/GTX Transceiver User Guide
         
   - Clarify that demo testbench disables certain default configurations when
     simulating irrespective of the GUI selections
   - See CR #500146
      - Add information in the GUI and Getting Started Guide to indicate which 
        default configurations are disabled by the demo testbench, and hence
        not reflected in demo testbench simulations
 
4. KNOWN ISSUES 
   
   The following are known issues for v1.6 of this core at time of release:
   
   - Implementation of Tri-speed GMII interface fails in MAP due to not being 
     able to place a clock pin and BUFG in the same half of the device
   - See CR #507608
     - When a design with EMAC0 and EMAC1 configured with Tri-speed GMII 
       interface is implemented, it fails in MAP with the following error:

       ERROR:Place:592 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been 
       found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair.

     WORKAROUND:
     To avoid this failure, add the following constraint in the UCF:
     INST "mii_tx_clk_0" LOC = "BANK3";
     
   - Verilog timing simulation runs forever for SGMII interface configured in 
     10/100 Mbps speeds
   - See CR #500591
     - When running timing simulation for a design with SGMII interface 
       configured in 10/100Mbps, numerous error messages resembling the 
       following get output and the testbench times out:

       # Memory Collision Error on X_ARAMB36_INTERNAL : testbench.dut.\
       v5_emac_ll/v5_emac_block_inst/GTX_DUAL_1000X_inst/
       rx_elastic_buffer_inst_0/dual_port_block_ram.INT_RAMB.chk_for_col_msg 
       at simulation time 40267.062 ns.
       # A read was performed on address 0XX0 (hex) of port A while a write was
       requested to the same address on port B. The write will be successful 
       however the read value on port A is unknown until the next CLKA cycle.
