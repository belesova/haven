Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
TX (transmit) DMA buffer for szedata. Technically this is a wrapper over
mem2nfifo component transforming its interface into Internal Bus on input
and Framelink(s) on output. There is also an interface to DMA controller.
After receiving newlen signal with aligned length in Bytes from DMA ctrl
data is being parsed (see documentation) and sent. After sending a frame
(EOF_N) RELLEN signal is send back to controller to free memory.

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
TX (transmit) DMA buffer for packets. Technically this is a wrapper over
mem2nfifo component transforming its interface into Internal Bus on input
and Framelink(s) on output. There is also an interface to DMA controller.
After receiving newlen signal with UNaligned length in Bytes from DMA ctrl
data is being parsed (a frame has NEWLEN length) and sent. After sending
a frame (EOF_N) RELLEN signal with unaligned length (same value as NEWLEN)
is send back to controller to free memory. NEWLEN signal is stored in sh_fifo
for parsing purpose.
