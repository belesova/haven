Status update:
-----------------
Sync flags:
	- necessary information is channel index for which the flag will be
	cleared
	- there are two ways of detecting the moment when the flag should be
	cleared
		+ monitoring of read transaction and detecting its end (on my
		own)
			* channel index could be obtained from read address
			* problem with detecting the end of read transaction
		+ wait for DMA done
			* channel index has to be stored somewhere and
			obtained when DMA done arrives
				# store in fifo - have to keep full signal in
				mind
				# store in DMA tag - exhausts some of DMA tag
				data space - don`t mind as it will otherwise
				stay unused
