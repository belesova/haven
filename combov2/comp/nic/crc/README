Directory description:

Folowing directories contain implementation of Ethernet CRC using table
method and serial method

crc8     - table method, 8-bits in each clock cycle
crc16    - table method, 16-bits in each clock cycle
crc32    - table method, 32-bits in each clock cycle
crc8s    - based on serial method, but transformed to implementation where
           8-bits of input data are processed in each clock cycle
tools    - an utility for the CRC-table equations generation
