                            MI8 to MI32 Transformer
                           =========================

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
It converts MI (Memory Interface) from 8b data width to 32b.

If the connected component doesn't suport BE signals for writing, generic
BE_SUPPORTED must be set to false and all transactions MUST be aligned to
32 bits.

It's not well tested, probably there is a bug (it stucks when trying to 
write when BE_SUPPORTED is false)
