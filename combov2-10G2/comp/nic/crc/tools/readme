The CRC Table Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Author: Bidlo Michal <bidlom@fit.vutbr.cz>

crctab is an utility for generating equations for calculating CRC values for
a given n-bit sequence (typically n = 8, 16, 32,...). This approach to CRC
implementation enables us to optimize CRC computation substantially. The utility
includes the mostly used CRC generator polynomials for 16-, 32- and 64-bit CRC,
64-bit CRC is a limit of CRC width for now.

By running crctab with -h or without any parameter, the program displays a help
screen:

Usage: crctab CRCBITS PARBITS [-poly] [FILENAME]
   -h, nothing   show this help screen
   CRCBITS       the number of bits of the CRC intended
   PARBITS       the number of bits processed in parallel
   -poly         enables manual entering generator polynomial
   FILENAME      output file name or nothing for the standard output

The usage syntax is mandatory for valid CRC table generation. Arguments in
brackets are voluntary. crctab generates equations in VHDL and C/C++ format.
If -poly parameter is used, the user is asked to enter generator polynomial
manually. If no FILENAME is given, the equations are written to the standard
output.


Examples of using crctab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
generate 32-bit CRC equations for calculating 8 bits in parallel, use predefined
generator polynomial, write result to the standard output

   crctab 32 8

generate 64-bit CRC equations for calculating 32 bits in parallel, use
predefined generator polynomial, write result to file 'crc64'

   crctab 64 32 crc64

generate 32-bit CRC equations for calculating 16 bits in parallel, enter
generator polynommial manually, write result to file 'crc32'

   crctab 32 16 -poly crc32
