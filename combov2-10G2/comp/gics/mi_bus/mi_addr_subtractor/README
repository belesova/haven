                              ====================

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
It subtracts given value from address on MI interface. Other signals are not
affected.

It's useful when we need to convert address on MI to local address space of
connected component (strats at zero) and it cannot be done simply by truncating
some higher bits.
