                           =========================

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
This unit has two frame link interfaces (one input and one output). It simply
checks every packet in the flow and decides if processed packet is ICMP packet
or not. Only ICMPv4 packets it lets go further.

This unit was designed for demo purpose.
