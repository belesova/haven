    TSU_ADD component resides on add_on card provides transmition of time
    stamps (TS) from PTM card for the add on card design. There are three
    modes the TS can be transmitted by: INIT, SHORT and FAST mode. See below
    for more information.

        <port name="REFCLK"       dir="in" width="1">
            TSU_ADD design works mostly on PTM design frequency and it is
            driven by refclk clock signal from PTM card.

        <port name="PPFTS"        dir="in" width="1">
            Usually the last octet of TS is sent to TSU_ADD only. Therefore 
            we need to update the higher octets in different way. 
            It is done by PPFTS
            signal. When 40th bit of TS in PTM change its value from 1 to 0
            one PPFTS pulse is generated. If TSU_ADD notices a PPFTS pulse
            then it increments higher octets.

    <h1> TSU_ADD transmition modes description</h1>
    <p>
        TSU_ADD can work in 3 modes: INIT, SHORT and FAST:
        <ul>
            <li>
                
                INIT mode: TSU_ADD requests TSU_PTM to send the whole TS in
                sequence of 8 octets (64 bits). When those octets are
                beeing sent by TS_PTM port, TS_DV signal is set. All PPFTS
                pulses (see interface) during this phase are counted by
                TSU_ADD and in the end they are added to the recieved TS.
                So TS value in TSU_ADD unit should be very close to that
                one in TSU_PTM. 
            
            </li>

            <li>
                
                SHORT mode: TSU_ADD requests TSU_PTM to send the last octet
                of TS (7 downto 0). When this octet is beeing set on TS_PTM
                port, TS_DV signal is set. This mode differs from the FAST
                mode.  The last octet is sent via handshake. 
            
            </li>

            <li>
                
                FAST mode: This mode is set as default, when neither INIT
                nor SHORT is set. During this mode TSU_PTM is sending the
                last octet of TS simultanously without acknoledgement.
                Higher octets of TS are beeing incremented by 1 when PPFTS
                pulse is noticed. So TS in TSU_ADD unit should be very
                close to that one in TSU_PTM. 
            
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
