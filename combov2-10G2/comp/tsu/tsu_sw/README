                             Timestamp unit (sw)
                            =====================

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
This unit generates timestamps, controlled by sw therefore these timestamps are
not absolutely exact, but in many cases this is acceptable. Transmitted timestamps
are 64 bit length but inside the unit, there is extended - 96 bit precision.
