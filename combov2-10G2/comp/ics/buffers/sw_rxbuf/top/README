Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
RX (receive) DMA buffer for szedata. Technically this is a wrapper over
nfifo2mem component transforming its interface into Framelink(s) on input
and Internal Bus on output. There is also an interface to DMA controller.
Input data is filled with zeros up to DATA_WIDTH length after each EOF_N.
After a frame is written into memory, newlen signal with aligned length
in Bytes is sent to DMA ctrl (with latency due to internal architecture).
RX_NEWLEN_RDY is ignored. (Controller is always ready.)

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
RX (receive) DMA buffer for packets. Technically this is a wrapper over
nfifo2mem component transforming its interface into Framelink(s) on input
and Internal Bus on output. There is also an interface to DMA controller.
Input data is filled with zeros up to DATA_WIDTH length after each EOF_N.
After a packet is written into memory, newlen signal with UNaligned length
in Bytes is stored into shift FIFO (with latency due to internal architecture).
DMA ctrl reads it with RX_NEWLEN_RDY. RX_RELLEN can be unaligned length,
buffer aligns it before passing to nfifo2mem. (These are the only differences
against szedata version.)
