Xilinx PCI Express Block Plus - ModelSim simulation howto
=========================================================

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Xilinx ISE 9.1 installed
 - ModelSim SE 6.2 or greater installed
 
ModelSim setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
1. There must be all of unisim, simprim, xilinxcorelib, unisims_ver, 
   simprims_ver and xilinxcorelib_ver libraries compiled and mapped in the 
   ModelSim. In order to that run the following command:

   compxlib -w -s mti_se -arch virtex5 -lib all -l all -dir <DIRECTORY> -smartmodel_setup
         
   This command will compile all libraries for both VHDL and Verilog and setups 
   the library mapping in the Modelsim.ini file. The <DIRECTORY> is the output 
   directory for compiled libraries.
   
2. Be sure the following statements are enabled and set as follows in the 
   $MODELTECH/Modelsim.ini file:
   
   For Linux:
   
   Veriuser = $MODEL_TECH/libswiftpli.sl 
   libsm = $MODEL_TECH/libsm.sl 
   libswift = $LMC_HOME/lib/x86_linux.lib/libswift.so 

   For Windows:
   
   Veriuser=$MODEL_TECH/libswiftpli.dll 
   libsm = $MODEL_TECH/libsm.dll 
   libswift=$LMC_HOME/lib/pcnt.lib/libswift.dll 
   
   Also, be sure the $LMC_HOME variable is set.

Testbench, how to simulate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. The simulated sequence of PCI-E read and write transactions is defined in
   the tests.v file (in Verilog). You can change the sequence as you require.
   See pages 126-134 in the "LogiCORE™ PCI Express Endpoint Block Plus v1.1 
   User Guide" for list and syntax of commands available.

2. Run the pcie.fdo command in the ModelSim (run "vsim -do pcie.fdo" in the 
   shell command line or run "do pcie.fdo" in the ModelSim's command window)
   
3. Be patient, the simulation takes some time, first transaction occurs in 
   simulation time about 100us.
