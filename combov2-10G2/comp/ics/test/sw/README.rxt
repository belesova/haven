3. Examples of usage
====================
 
The command::

  %  ics_test -o 0x0 -s 16 -c write -f data -D 2

Reads file ``data`` for 16 bytes. Writes read data at offset 0x0 to fpga memory.
Provides debug printings.

The command::

  %  ics_test -o 0x0 -s 16 -c l2gw -f data

Reads file ``data`` for 16 bytes. Writes read data at offset 0x0 to fpga memory,
then calls l2gw transaction.

The command::

  %  ics_test -o 0x0 -s 16 -c g2lr -f data

Reads file ``data`` for 16 bytes. Writes read data at offset 0x0 to RAM,
